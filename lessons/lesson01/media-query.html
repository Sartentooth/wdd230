                <h2>1 Nefi 1:20</h2>
                <p>And when the Jews heard these things they were angry with him; yea, even as with the prophets of old,
                    whom they had acast out, and stoned, and slain; and they also bsought his life, that they might take
                    it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender cmercies of the Lord are over all
                    those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of
                    ddeliverance.</p>

                <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord
                    hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no bcommandments unto the children of men, save he
                    shall cprepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>
