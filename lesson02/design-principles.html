        <h4>CONTRAST</h4>

        <p>The contrast is one of the main principles since it is about the differences, on the page we see the
          different elements, such as text, images, buttons, videos maintain a contrast between them, allowing to make
          clear the reading of the site and to have a pleasant view of all the information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every good design has a strong and clear focal point and having a clear contrast between the elements helps.

        <h4>ALIGNMENT</h4>
        <h5>Foundry VTT</h5>
        <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/" target="_blank">Foundry VTT</a>
        <img src="images/parc-alignment.png" alt="PARC_alignment screenshot">
        <p>In the alignment on this web page I like, both the titles and the other elements and highlight the given that
          is where the view focuses almost immediately. It looks organized and there is a purpose that fulfills the
          objective of guiding the user to what is most relevant.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way they are distributed shows that it would be easy to use a grid to align each of the elements. And in
          general, they show a visual connection.

        <h4>WHITE SPACE AND CLEAR DESIGN</h4>
        <h5>Google</h5>
        <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>
        <img src="images/white-space.png" alt="white_space screenshot">
        <p>As seen on the page, we see a clear example of the use of white space macros providing not only simplicity
          but a balance
          between the elements. In this specific case, it focuses the view on the objective and does not distract the
          user but acts as a container for the design in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          The macro white space on the page helps maintain order, providing the right and necessary elements for what
          the site was created, which is the search for something.
